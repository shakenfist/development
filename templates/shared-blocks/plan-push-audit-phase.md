<!-- shared-block: plan-push-audit-phase v1 -->
Push audit phase (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-push-audit-phase.md`):

- Every master plan ends with a phase that runs the repository's
  `PUSH-AUDIT.md` over the whole plan's work. It is the last row of
  the Execution table and it is not optional.
- That phase audits the accumulated diff of every phase in the plan
  against the default branch, not the diff of the last phase alone.
  Auditing one phase at a time would miss what the phases did to
  each other -- the duplicated helper that only exists once phases
  three and six have both landed, the doc page that phase two made
  wrong and phase five never revisited.
- Findings land as their own pull request against the default
  branch, and the plan is not complete until they are resolved or
  explicitly declined in writing. A finding that is declined says
  why, in the plan, where the next reader will find it.
- Where the audit finds nothing, record that in the plan in one
  sentence. It is a real result, and a run of them is the evidence
  for making the phase conditional rather than mandatory.
- A repository with no `PUSH-AUDIT.md` still carries the phase, and
  the phase says that the runbook does not exist yet and what was
  done instead. Silently omitting it is what let the audit go
  untriggered for as long as it did.
