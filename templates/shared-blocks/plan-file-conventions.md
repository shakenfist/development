<!-- shared-block: plan-file-conventions v2 -->
Plan file conventions (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-file-conventions.md`):

- All planning documents live in `docs/plans/`.
- Detailed planning gets one plan file per phase. Phase files are
  named for their master plan, sit in the same directory as it,
  and append `-phase-NN-descriptive` before the `.md` extension.
- The master plan tracks its phases in a table under its Execution
  section. `Merged` is last, and the push audit is the last row,
  for the reasons given in `plan-push-audit-phase`:

  | Phase | Plan | Status | Merged |
  |-------|------|--------|--------|
  | 1. Schema migration | PLAN-thing-phase-01-schema.md | Not started | |
  | 2. Public API | PLAN-thing-phase-02-api.md | Not started | |
  | 3. Push audit | - | Not started | |

- One commit per logical change, and at minimum one commit per
  phase. Unrelated changes are not batched into a single commit.
  Each commit is self-contained: it builds, passes tests, and has
  a message explaining what changed and why.
