<!-- shared-block: plan-phase-references v1 -->
Plan phase references (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-phase-references.md`):

- Documentation outside plans directories describes the current
  state of the software, not the history of how it was built. Do
  not write "implemented in phase 5" or "since phase 3 of the
  two-tier CI plan": a reader wants to know whether a feature
  exists, not which phase of which plan delivered it.
- If a documented behaviour is implemented, describe it plainly.
  If it is planned but not yet implemented, link to the master
  plan in `docs/plans/` instead of citing a phase number.
- Reserve the word "phase" for plan documents. A procedural
  document describing a live multi-stage process (a release
  runbook, say) should call its stages "steps" or "stages", so
  that a phase reference in `docs/` is always a plan smell.
- The consistency audit greps `README.md` and `docs/` (excluding
  plans directories) for "phase <number>". Append
  `<!-- audit-ok: phase-reference -->` to a line only when the
  reference is genuinely not about an implementation plan.
