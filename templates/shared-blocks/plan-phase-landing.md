<!-- shared-block: plan-phase-landing v1 -->
Phase landing (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical copy
lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-phase-landing.md`):

A plan's status and a repository's review state both live in files
that every branch would otherwise rewrite. Left alone, that turns
each of them into a merge-conflict hot spot, and it spends a pull
request and a full CI run on a change that is entirely prose.
Three rules keep them out of the way.

- **A phase is closed out in the first commit of the next phase,
  not in a pull request of its own.** By the time the next phase
  branches, the previous one has merged, so its merge commit is
  known and its `Merged` cell can record the thing the push-audit
  phase actually needs. This is the only ordering that works: a
  phase cannot record its own merge commit, and a separate
  close-out pull request buys that record at the price of a round
  trip. The close-out sets the finished phase's `Status` and
  `Merged` cells and the plan's row in `docs/plans/index.md`, and
  it is committed before the next phase's own work, so that the
  branch never claims the plan is further along than the default
  branch is.

- **The last phase closes itself out.** The push-audit phase is
  the last row of every plan, so no next phase will carry its
  close-out. Where the audit raises findings, the plan is not
  complete until they are resolved or declined, and those land as
  their own pull request after the audit phase has merged -- so
  that pull request is the carrier, and it can record the audit
  phase's merge commit, which by then is known. Where the audit
  finds nothing there is no carrier, and no follow-up pull
  request is opened for the sake of one cell: the phase sets its
  own `Status`, and the plan's index row, to `Complete` in its
  own pull request, and records no `Merged` cell. It is the only
  row permitted to omit one. The column exists so that the
  push-audit phase can reconstruct what to audit; the audit phase
  is last, so nothing ever reads its own row.

- **`REVIEWS.md` is not pruned or regenerated in a pull request
  that changes code or documentation.** Editing a reviewed file
  stales its mark, and adding or removing an in-scope file moves
  the header count, but neither is the landing pull request's
  business. `prune` regenerates the file whether or not it dropped
  anything, so the `prune-reviews` workflow heals both on the next
  push to the default branch. Pruning from a branch is also wrong
  more often than it is right, though not for the reason it first
  appears: `prune` compares each stamp against `HEAD`, which on a
  branch is the branch tip, so it drops the marks for the files the
  pull request itself touched while keeping marks the default
  branch has already pruned. Committing that state merges a review
  file computed from a stale tree, and can resurrect marks
  `prune-reviews` has already removed. Accumulated staleness is
  reported by the `review-coverage` audit, which recomputes
  coverage against `HEAD` and raises an issue once the backlog is
  worth a review session.

  **A review session is the exception**, and it is not optional
  tidiness: `stamp` regenerates `REVIEWS.md` as well as writing the
  marks, and the rows, the sidecars and the marks are committed
  together (see `docs/code-review-tracking.md`). Where a repository
  requires a pull request to reach its default branch, that is how
  a review session lands, so "not in a pull request" is about the
  kind of change, not the mechanism.

These rules assume phases land one after another. Where two phase
branches are open at once, each closes out only the phase it
directly follows.
