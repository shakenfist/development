<!-- shared-block: source-file-size v1 -->
Source file size (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/source-file-size.md`):

- Where a repository tracks whole-file human review, a file's cost
  is its length times how often it is touched: every change
  discards the review of the whole file, and the next session
  re-reads all of it. That, rather than taste, is why length is
  worth raising in review at all.
- Treat a source file over roughly 800 lines as a candidate to
  split, and one over roughly 1,500 as wanting a stated reason to
  stay whole. Both are advisory. Neither is a gate, there is no
  hard cap, and a reviewer who raises one is opening a question,
  not recording a defect.
- Generated files, vendored trees and protocol or data tables are
  exempt: they are not read the way source is, and a tool that
  counts them is measuring the wrong thing.
- Split along a seam that already exists -- one module's public
  entry point, one check, one subcommand, one endpoint -- so that
  a later change touches one of the pieces rather than all of
  them. A file split at a line number rather than at a seam is
  worse than the long file it replaced.
- Length is never reduced by deleting the comments and docstrings
  that explain why the code is the way it is. Those are what make
  a long file reviewable, and trading them for a line count makes
  the review worse while making the number better. Cut duplicated
  scaffolding first; see `comment-proportion` for what earns its
  length.
