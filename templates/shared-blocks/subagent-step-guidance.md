Sub-agent step guidance (shared block; do not edit -- the
canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/subagent-step-guidance.md`):

Each phase plan includes a table like this:

| Step | Effort | Model | Isolation | Brief for sub-agent |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1a | medium | sonnet | none | One-sentence summary of what to do and which files to touch |
| 1b | high | opus | worktree | Why this needs high effort: requires understanding X to do Y |

**Effort levels**, from cheapest to most thorough:

- **low** -- Purely mechanical changes: rename, reformat, add a
  log line, regenerate generated code. The brief is a complete
  instruction.
- **medium** -- The plan provides enough context to follow a clear
  brief. The sub-agent may read a few files, but the approach is
  already decided.
- **high** -- Requires reading several files, making judgment
  calls, or understanding non-obvious invariants. The sub-agent
  needs to think about edge cases.
- **xhigh** -- The setting for hard coding and agentic steps:
  long-horizon changes, or steps where the sub-agent must both
  research and implement.
- **max** -- Correctness matters more than cost. Expect
  diminishing returns and occasional overthinking; reserve it for
  steps where a wrong answer would be expensive to detect.

**Brief for sub-agent:** this is the key field. Write it as if
briefing a colleague who has never seen the codebase. Include what
to change, which files to touch, what patterns to follow, and any
non-obvious constraints.

A good brief front-loads the research the planner already did, so
the implementing agent does not repeat it. Instead of "add storage
functions for the new object", name the functions to add, the file
they belong in, the existing equivalent to mirror (with line
numbers), and any registration the change also needs.

The better the brief, the lower the effort level needed and the
lighter the model that can succeed.
